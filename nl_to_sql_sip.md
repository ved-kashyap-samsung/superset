## [SIP] Proposal for natural language query to SQL conversion using LLM 

### Motivation

#### Converting natural language commands to SQL queries can enhance user experience and accessibility by:

- **Simplicity**: Users can interact with databases using everyday language, reducing the learning curve for querying databases.
- **Efficiency**: Natural language commands can be faster to input and understand compared to writing complex SQL queries, especially for non-technical users. 
- **Accessibility**: It allows a wider range of users, including those without SQL proficiency, to access and utilize databases effectively.
- **Flexibility**: Natural language understanding can handle variations in how users express queries, providing a more flexible interface.
- **Productivity**: Streamlining the query process frees up time for users to focus on analyzing and interpreting the data rather than wrestling with query syntax.

### Proposed Change

Describe how the feature will be implemented, or the problem will be solved. If possible, include mocks, screenshots, or screencasts (even if from different tools).

### New or Changed Public Interfaces

Describe any new additions to the model, views or `REST` endpoints. Describe any changes to existing visualizations, dashboards and React components. Describe changes that affect the Superset CLI and how Superset is deployed.

### New dependencies

Describe any `npm`/`PyPI` packages that are required. Are they actively maintained? What are their licenses?

### Migration Plan and Compatibility

Describe any database migrations that are necessary, or updates to stored URLs.

### Rejected Alternatives

Describe alternative approaches that were considered and rejected.
