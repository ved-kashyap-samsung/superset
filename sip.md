## [SIP] Proposal for data summarization using LLM 

### Motivation

#### Summarizing SQL returned data using Language Models (LLMs) adds further value by:

- **Insight Extraction**: LLMs can extract key insights from large datasets, providing users with concise summaries of the most relevant information.
- **Contextual Understanding**: LLMs can contextualize data summaries based on the user's query, offering personalized insights tailored to their needs.
- **Automation**: Automating the summarization process reduces the manual effort required to sift through vast amounts of data, increasing efficiency and productivity.
- **Consistency**: LLMs ensure consistency in summarization by following predefined rules, reducing the risk of human error and bias.
- **Scalability**: As datasets grow, LLMs can scale to handle larger volumes of data while still providing accurate and relevant summaries, ensuring the usability of the system over time.
